	abstract = {Current design practice in the United States allows engineers to use either Allowable Strength Design (ASD) or Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) method, under the assumption that both methods provide similar levels of economy (available design strengths) and safety (probabilities of failure and reliability indices) regardless of the design conditions. Recent studies have demonstrated that significant differences in economy can arise between ASD- and LRFD-based designs subjected to combinations of gravity and wind loads, suggesting inconsistencies between the safety levels. This study investigates the safety levels provided by the ASD and LRFD methods for such design cases. The safety levels were estimated using a formal reliability analysis with consideration of geometrically non-linear second-order effects. The reliability analysis was performed using Monte Carlo simulations with appropriate probability distributions for the random variables associated with both resistance and loads. The findings of this study indicate that generally accepted uniformity of reliabilities ach­ ieved by the ASD and LRFD methods does not hold for design cases governed by wind loads. The safety levels achieved by using the ASD method are less consistent than those achieved by using the LRFD method. The use of the ASD method generally entails the acceptance of failure risks many times greater than for those of the LRFD method, and target safety levels lower than those stipulated by the ASCE 7 Standard. These results highlight the need for a reevaluation of the current design practices to ensure that the required target levels of structural safety are consistently met.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the UQpy software toolbox, an open-source Python package for general uncertainty quan­ tification (UQ) in mathematical and physical systems. The software serves as both a user-ready toolbox that includes many of the latest methods for UQ in computational modeling and a convenient development envi­ ronment for Python programmers advancing the field of UQ. The paper presents an introduction to the software’s architecture and existing capabilities, divided in the code in a set of modules centered around different UQ tasks such as sampling methods, generation of random processes and random fields, probabilistic inverse modeling, reliability analysis, surrogate modeling, and active learning. The paper also highlights the importance of the RunModel module, which is used to drive simulations in the uncertainty analyses performed in UQpy. This module conveniently allows the user to define computational models directly in Python, or to run simulations from a third-party software in serial or in parallel. To illustrate the various capabilities, two examples are tracked throughout the paper and analyzed repeatedly for various UQ tasks. The first is a Python model solving a nonlinear structural dynamics problem, used to illustrate UQpy’s capabilities in sampling and forward propa­ gation of high dimensional random vectors (stochastic processes), and probabilistic inference. The second model is a third-party Abaqus finite element model solving the thermomechanical response of a beam structure. This example is used to illustrate UQpy’s capabilities in variance reduction sampling techniques, reliability analysis, surrogate modeling and active learning techniques.},

	abstract = {ASCE 7, Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures, provides load combinations for both Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) and for Allowable Stress Design (ASD), defining the required strength of structural members and connections. Similarly, the AISC Specification for Structural Steel Buildings provides resistance factors for LRFD and safety factors for ASD to be applied to the nominal strength for each limit state, permitting design using either method in conjunction with the corresponding load combinations in ASCE 7. Previous publications have demonstrated that similar designs (with similar levels of reliability) result from the application of LRFD and ASD for cases in which the governing load combination has live load as the principal load. This study presents comparison of ASD and LRFD demands, and corresponding reliability indices, from ASCE 7 lateral load combinations, determined with different proportions of dead, live, wind, and seismic load effects and a range of levels of second-order effects. The findings indicate that the generally accepted uniformity between the two design methods established for gravity load combinations does not always extend to lateral load combinations. For a range of conditions, design using ASD load combinations provides significantly lower reliability than using LRFD and does not meet the ASCE 7 reliability target.},

	abstract = {We present ForwardDiff, a Julia package for forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD) featuring performance competitive with low-level languages like C++. Unlike recently developed AD tools in other popular high-level languages such as Python and MATLAB, ForwardDiff takes advantage of just-in-time (JIT) compilation to transparently recompile AD-unaware user code, enabling efficient support for higher-order differentiation and differentiation using custom number types (including complex numbers). For gradient and Jacobian calculations, ForwardDiff provides a variant of vector-forward mode that avoids expensive heap allocation and makes better use of memory bandwidth than traditional vector mode. In our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that for nontrivially large dimensions, ForwardDiff's gradient computations can be faster than a reverse-mode implementation from the Python-based autograd package. We also illustrate how ForwardDiff is used effectively within JuMP, a modeling language for optimization. According to our usage statistics, 41 unique repositories on GitHub depend on ForwardDiff, with users from diverse fields such as astronomy, optimization, finite element analysis, and statistics. This document is an extended abstract that has been accepted for presentation at the AD2016 7th International Conference on Algorithmic Differentiation.},
